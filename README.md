# OSI Module Project

## Overview

The **OSI Module Project** is a Python-based interactive representation of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. It simulates the data flow through the seven layers of the OSI model, providing users with a visual and step-by-step understanding of how network communication works at each layer. This project is an educational tool for those interested in networking and computer science.

## Features

- Visual and text-based representation of all 7 OSI layers.
- Simulates data encapsulation and de-capsulation processes.
- Interactive command-line interface to choose between different operations (Sender, Receiver, OSI Layers).
- Illustrates different networking protocols and their functionalities.
- Includes basic simulation of network operations such as email browsing, web browsing, and file transfer.

## OSI Model Layers Covered

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**
6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**

## Usage

1. **Sender Mode**: Simulates the sending of data through the OSI layers from the application layer to the physical layer.
2. **Receiver Mode**: Simulates the receiving of data from the physical layer up to the application layer.
3. **OSI Layers**: Provides a textual representation and explanation of all seven layers of the OSI model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of networking concepts and the OSI model.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OSI_Module_Project.git
   cd OSI_Module_Project

2. **Run the Script**:

    ```bash
    python OSI_MODEL.py
